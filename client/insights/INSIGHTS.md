# client — insights

Notes the previous session left for this one. Append-only: add dated entries,
never rewrite old ones — supersede them with a new entry instead.

## What Works

### 2026-10-08 — Count from the list the cards render from
`FindingsPanel` derives the severity pills from the same array it renders
(after "hide low confidence"), so a pill can never disagree with the cards below
it. Counting the raw `findings` prop looks equivalent until the toggle is on.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/_components/FindingsPanel/FindingsPanel.tsx:37`

## What Doesn't Work

### 2026-10-07 — The design's `toFixed(3)` cost format hides real runs
The mockup's `CostBadge` formats below $1 with `toFixed(3)`, so a typical
$0.00015 review renders as `$0.000` — the fake zero the spec forbids. Use
`formatCost`, which keeps three significant digits below $1.
Evidence: `src/lib/format-cost.ts:9`

## Codebase Patterns

### 2026-10-08 — Popovers in the PR list must be portalled
`tableCard` clips with `overflow: hidden` (it keeps the rounded corners), so an
absolutely positioned popover inside a row is cut off. `FindingsPopover` renders
into `document.body` with fixed positioning; its scroll-close listener ignores
scroll events from inside the popover, or scrolling its own list would close it.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/styles.ts:90`, `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/_components/FindingsCell/FindingsCell.tsx:45`

### 2026-10-08 — The skill prompt block is duplicated on purpose
The Preview tab shows the exact `<skill name="…">` block the reviewer gets.
`promptBlock` re-implements `wrapSkill` from reviewer-core because the client
cannot import reviewer-core. Changing the escaping or the name rule in one place
without the other makes the preview lie.
Evidence: `src/app/skills/helpers.ts:18`, `../reviewer-core/src/prompt.ts:46`

### 2026-10-08 — Missing message keys are caught by a test, not by next-intl
next-intl only logs a missing key and renders it raw; typecheck and component
tests stay green. `i18n-keys.test.ts` scans every literal `t("…")` against
`messages/en` (it caught a key dropped while reorganising `skills.json`). Keys
built with template literals are not covered.
Evidence: `src/lib/i18n-keys.test.ts:1`

### 2026-10-08 — A query nested under `["reviews", prId]` refreshes with the reviews
`useSmartDiff` is keyed `["reviews", prId, "smart-diff"]`, so every existing
`invalidateQueries(["reviews", prId])` (run finished, finding accepted or
rejected) refreshes the finding markers with no new wiring. The flip side: code
that reads all `["reviews", …]` queries at once would now also get a SmartDiff.
Evidence: `src/lib/hooks/smart-diff.ts:11`, `src/lib/hooks/reviews.ts:68`

### 2026-10-22 — The diff viewer renders page cards through a render prop
`components/diff-viewer` sits below the PR page and must not import its `FindingCard`
or hooks. DiffTab owns the findings (`usePrReviews`) and the action (`useFindingAction`)
and passes a `DiffFindingApi` (`visible`, `render(finding)`); the viewer only decides
where a card goes: under the anchored line or in the off-patch list at the file end.
Evidence: `src/components/diff-viewer/helpers.ts:55`, `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/_components/DiffTab/DiffTab.tsx:58`

### 2026-10-13 — A deep-link line can be missing from the patch the tab renders
The Brief card's references are grounded on the review diff loader's diff; Files
changed renders `pr_files` patches from GitHub. They usually agree, but not always
(GitHub truncates large patches; `pr_files` can lag the head). `FileCard` scrolls to
the file whenever the focus line is not among its rendered lines, rather than only when
there is no line at all, so a link never lands nowhere.
Evidence: `src/components/diff-viewer/FileCard/FileCard.tsx:56`

## Tool & Library Notes

### 2026-10-07 — `messages/en/runs.json` is not uniformly indented
The `"copied"` key sits at a different indent from its siblings. Loading and
re-dumping the file with a JSON library re-indents it and adds an unrelated
line to the diff. Insert new keys textually next to their neighbours.
Evidence: `messages/en/runs.json:71`

### 2026-10-07 — Headless screenshots of the PR page never "settle"
The PR detail page polls active runs every 4 s and keeps an `EventSource` open,
so Chrome's `--virtual-time-budget` waits forever. Use `--timeout=<ms>` and kill
the process after the file appears.
Evidence: `src/lib/hooks/reviews.ts:33`, `src/lib/hooks/reviews.ts:181`

### 2026-10-08 — `SeverityBadge` puts the label before the count
`<SeverityBadge count={2} />` renders "CRITICAL 2". For the "2 CRITICAL" format
use `SeverityPill` from `src/components/severity`.
Evidence: `src/vendor/ui/primitives/Badge.tsx:80`

### 2026-10-08 — Runtime zod schemas: import the contract file, not the barrel
`import { SkillInput } from "@devdigest/shared"` passes `pnpm typecheck` and
vitest, then `next dev` answers 500 on the page: a value import pulls
`vendor/shared/index.ts` into webpack, and its `./contracts/*.js` re-exports do
not resolve. Import the schema from `@/vendor/shared/contracts/<file>` instead —
it works as long as that file imports nothing but `zod`. Types can still come
from the barrel.
Evidence: `src/app/skills/_components/SkillConfigForm/SkillConfigForm.tsx:11`, `src/lib/feature-models.ts:6`

### 2026-10-08 — A new route breaks `pnpm typecheck` until Next regenerates its types
`tsconfig.json` includes `.next/types/**`. After adding `app/repos/[repoId]/conventions`
the check failed in `.next/types/validator.ts` ("does not satisfy AppRoutes")
because the generated route list was stale. Opening the page once on the dev
server (or `next build`) regenerates it; the code was fine.
Evidence: `tsconfig.json:33`

### 2026-10-08 — jsdom's `File` has no `text()`
Components may use `await file.text()` (all current browsers have it), but in
tests define it on the test file: `Object.defineProperty(file, "text", …)`.
Evidence: `src/app/skills/_components/ImportSkillDrawer/ImportSkillDrawer.test.tsx:103`

### 2026-10-08 — `FileCard` reads `defaultOpen` once, on mount
The fold rules (boilerplate folded, files with findings open) apply only when a
card mounts. Switching Smart/Original order remounts the cards because they move
under different parents, which re-applies them; a new annotation inside the same
order does not refold a card the user already opened — intended.
Evidence: `src/components/diff-viewer/FileCard/FileCard.tsx:45`

### 2026-10-08 — The kit's `Markdown` did not style headings or lists
It overrode only `p`, `strong`, `code` and `a`, so repository documents and tour
sections showed headings and bullet lists as plain lines (the global CSS reset strips
them). Headings, lists and code blocks now have styles in `em`; `safe` mode keeps only
http(s) links and drops images for text written outside DevDigest.
Evidence: `src/vendor/ui/primitives/Markdown.tsx:28`

## Recurring Errors & Fixes

### 2026-10-08 — A disabled-and-pressed toggle traps the user
Disabling every filter button whose level has zero findings also disabled the
*active* one once "hide low confidence" emptied its level, leaving a pressed
button that could not be released. Fix: never disable the active filter.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/_components/FindingsPanel/FindingsPanel.tsx:93`

### 2026-10-08 — `borderColor` is a shorthand too
React warns "Updating borderColor … when a conflicting property is set" if a
style object holds `borderColor` next to `borderLeftColor` and a rerender
changes it. FindingCard did, so every severity filter click logged the warning
(the Next dev badge showed "1 Issue"). Use per-side colours.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/_components/FindingCard/styles.ts:10`

### 2026-10-14 — A bulk action must lock the other cards, not just itself
"Accept all" disabled only its own button; the cards' Accept/Reject stayed live, so a
click during the loop started a second accept in parallel (and could race for one skill
name). The page passes `locked` to every card while a bulk action runs.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/conventions/page.tsx:84`

### 2026-10-08 — Starter message files are not plural-aware
`blast.json` shipped `"{count} callers"` and bare `"symbols"`, so the card read
"1 callers", "1 symbols". Use ICU plurals and pass `count` even to labels that
sit next to a separately rendered number.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/_components/BlastRadiusCard/BlastRadiusCard.tsx:48`

### 2026-10-08 — The agent page had its own list of tabs
`/agents/[id]/page.tsx` validated `?tab=` against a hardcoded `["config", "skills"]`,
so the new Context tab rendered in the bar but every click fell back to Config. Only
the browser check caught it — component tests render the tab directly. The page now
reads the editor's `TABS` through `editorTab()`.
Evidence: `src/app/agents/[id]/page.tsx:24`, `src/app/agents/[id]/_components/AgentEditor/helpers.ts:5`

### 2026-10-13 — `parsePatch` numbered the no-newline marker and the trailing empty line
Both became context lines with old and new numbers, so git-why offered "why" on
`\ No newline at end of file` (the server rightly answered 404) and a phantom last line
could be focused. The parser drops the marker and the empty string after a final
newline.
Evidence: `src/components/diff-viewer/helpers.ts:22`

## Session Notes

### 2026-10-07 — Lab 1: run cost
Added `formatCost` + `CostBadge`; cost now shows in the PR list Cost column,
on each timeline run tile and as a COST block in the trace drawer. Checked on
a live run via screenshots of all three places.
Evidence: `src/lib/format-cost.ts:21`, `src/components/cost-badge/CostBadge.tsx:7`

### 2026-10-08 — Homework 1: findings by severity
Severity pills + filter in review run cards, severity icons on timeline tiles,
FINDINGS column with a read-only hover preview in the PR list. Verified with a
scripted browser on live reviews of demo PR #3: pills 1/1/2, Critical filter
leaves the single SSRF card, preview shows 4 findings and no buttons.
Evidence: `src/lib/findings.ts:13`, `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/_components/FindingsCell/FindingsCell.tsx:17`

### 2026-10-08 — Lab 2: Skills Lab
`/skills` (library, editor with Config / Preview / Stats / Versions, URL import
drawer), Skills tab in the agent editor (link, reorder by drag or arrows), and
`name@vN` per skill in the trace drawer's Configuration. Checked in a scripted
browser against the live API: link two skills, import a SKILL.md from GitHub
(lands disabled, "needs vetting"), edit a body → v2 with a one-line diff.
Evidence: `src/app/skills/page.tsx:20`, `src/app/agents/[id]/_components/AgentEditor/_components/SkillsTab/SkillsTab.tsx:20`

### 2026-10-08 — Lab 2, part 2: Conventions page and file import
`/repos/:repoId/conventions` (scan on click, evidence linked to GitHub lines,
Accept as Skill / Edit first / Reject, bulk actions) and a From file tab in the
import drawer. Verified in a scripted browser on live scans of this repo.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/conventions/page.tsx:23`, `src/app/skills/_components/ImportSkillDrawer/ImportSkillDrawer.tsx:26`

### 2026-10-08 — Lab 5: Project Context, agent Context tab, Onboarding Tour
Shared pieces for both screens live in `src/components/context-doc`. The Context tab
follows the sidebar's active repo — with an uncloned repo it lists nothing and says so,
without calling attached paths missing.
Evidence: `src/components/context-doc/index.ts:1`, `src/app/agents/[id]/_components/AgentEditor/_components/ContextTab/ContextTab.tsx:1`

### 2026-10-13 — Homework 5: Brief card, deep links, git-why panel
Overview gets the Brief card (generate on click only); every reference opens
`?tab=diff&file=&line=`; Files changed gets a "why" button on base lines, hidden when
the PR's base is not the active repo's default branch.
Evidence: `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/_components/BriefCard/BriefCard.tsx:24`, `src/app/repos/[repoId]/pulls/[number]/page.tsx:196`
