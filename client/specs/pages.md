## PR list — `/repos/:repoId/pulls`

Columns: Pull request · Author · Size · Score · Findings · Status · Cost · Updated.

- **Score** — latest review's score, `—` when never reviewed.
- **Status** — derived on the server: needs review / reviewed / stale for open
  PRs, GitHub state otherwise.
- **Findings** — severity icons of the latest review; hover opens a read-only
  preview of its findings (`findings-by-severity.md`).
- **Cost** — `PrMeta.cost_usd`, rendered per `run-cost-display.md`.
- Opening the list syncs PRs from GitHub when a token is set; without one it
  serves what is persisted.

## PR detail — `/repos/:repoId/pulls/:number`

The PR id is resolved from `:number` through the repo's PR list (`usePulls`),
then:

- `usePullDetail` → `GET /pulls/:id` — body, files, commits. Opening this page is
  also what persists `pr_files` on the server.
- `usePrReviews` → `GET /pulls/:id/reviews` — review runs with their findings.
- `usePrRuns` → `GET /pulls/:id/runs` — the timeline (every run, any status).
- `usePrActiveRuns` → `GET /pulls/:id/runs/active` — polled while runs are live.
- Trace drawer (`?trace=<runId>`) → `GET /runs/:id/trace`, live log over SSE.

**Agent runs tab** (`?tab=findings`) has two sections:

- **Timeline** — runs and commits interleaved, newest first. A run tile shows
  its outcome badge, score ring, agent and model, severity icons, run time and
  cost; clicking the agent jumps to its review run, the file icon opens the trace.
- **Review runs** — one collapsible card per review run: verdict banner with PR
  score, the severity count row and filter buttons, then the findings with
  Accept / Dismiss and a "hide low confidence" toggle. The newest run is expanded
  by default.

No page triggers an LLM call by being opened. Model calls happen only from
**Run Review**.
